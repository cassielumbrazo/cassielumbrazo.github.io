> â€œPlein air painting is about leaving the four walls of your studio behind and experiencing painting and drawing *in* the landscape.[^1]"

In my healing journey, I have thrown myself into my art. I enjoy painting outdoors, where I can be *in* and fully emmersed by the landscape that I attempt to capture the likeness of. This type of experience does not limit my observations to what my eyes can see, but what my body can feel. 

Here are some of the en plein air adventures I've had this month.
