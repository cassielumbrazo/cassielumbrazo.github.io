## Memorial Book for Him

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.
